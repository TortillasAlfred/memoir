  abstract  = {In this work, we re-examine the problem of extractive text summarization for long documents. We observe that the process of extracting summarization of human can be divided into two stages: 1) a rough reading stage to look for sketched information, and 2) a subsequent careful reading stage to select key sentences to form the summary. By simulating such a two-stage process, we propose a novel approach for extractive summarization. We formulate the problem as a contextual-bandit problem and solve it with policy gradient. We adopt a convolutional neural network to encode gist of paragraphs for rough reading, and a decision making policy with an adapted termination mechanism for careful reading. Experiments on the CNN and DailyMail datasets show that our proposed method can provide high-quality summaries with varied length, and significantly outperform the state-of-the-art extractive methods in terms of ROUGE metrics.}

  abstract  = {This paper creates a paradigm shift with regard to the way we build neural extractive summarization systems. Instead of following the commonly used framework of extracting sentences individually and modeling the relationship between sentences, we formulate the extractive summarization task as a semantic text matching problem, in which a source document and candidate summaries will be (extracted from the original text) matched in a semantic space. Notably, this paradigm shift to semantic matching framework is well-grounded in our comprehensive analysis of the inherent gap between sentence-level and summary-level extractors based on the property of the dataset. Besides, even instantiating the framework with a simple form of a matching model, we have driven the state-of-the-art extractive result on CNN/DailyMail to a new level (44.41 in ROUGE-1). Experiments on the other five datasets also show the effectiveness of the matching framework. We believe the power of this matching-based summarization framework has not been fully exploited. To encourage more instantiations in the future, we have released our codes, processed dataset, as well as generated summaries in \url{https://github.com/maszhongming/MatchSum}.}

  abstract  = {Bandit based methods for tree search have recently gained popularity when applied to huge trees, e.g. in the game of go [6]. Their efficient exploration of the tree enables to return rapidly a good value, and improve precision if more time is provided. The UCT algorithm [8], a tree search method based on Upper Confidence Bounds (UCB) [2], is believed to adapt locally to the effective smoothness of the tree. However, we show that UCT is "over-optimistic" in some sense, leading to a worst-case regret that may be very poor. We propose alternative bandit algorithms for tree search. First, a modification of UCT using a confidence sequence that scales exponentially in the horizon depth is analyzed. We then consider Flat-UCB performed on the leaves and provide a finite regret bound with high probability. Then, we introduce and analyze a Bandit Algorithm for Smooth Trees (BAST) which takes into account actual smoothness of the rewards for performing efficient "cuts" of sub-optimal branches with high confidence. Finally, we present an incremental tree expansion which applies when the full tree is too big (possibly infinite) to be entirely represented and show that with high probability, only the optimal branches are indefinitely developed. We illustrate these methods on a global optimization problem of a continuous function, given noisy values.},

  abstract  = {The investigation and development of new methods from diverse perspectives to shed light on portfolio choice problems has never stagnated in financial research. Recently, multi-armed bandits have drawn intensive attention in various machine learning applications in online settings. The tradeoff between exploration and exploitation to maximize rewards in bandit algorithms naturally establishes a connection to portfolio choice problems. In this paper, we present a bandit algorithm for conducting online portfolio choices by effectually exploiting correlations among multiple arms. Through constructing orthogonal portfolios from multiple assets and integrating with the upper confidence bound bandit framework, we derive the optimal portfolio strategy that represents the combination of passive and active investments according to a risk-adjusted reward function. Compared with oft-quoted trading strategies in finance and machine learning fields across representative real-world market datasets, the proposed algorithm demonstrates superiority in both risk-adjusted return and cumulative wealth.},

We evaluate these activation function on standard image classification task.
Our experiments suggest that incorporating a non-zero slope for negative part
in rectified activation units could consistently improve the results. Thus our
findings are negative on the common belief that sparsity is the key of good
performance in ReLU. Moreover, on small scale dataset, using deterministic
negative slope or learning it are both prone to overfitting. They are not as
effective as using their randomized counterpart. By using RReLU, we achieved
75.68\% accuracy on CIFAR-100 test set without multiple test or ensemble.}},

We identify a weakness of LSTM networks processing continual input streams without explicitly marked sequence ends. Without resets, the internal state values may grow indefinitely and eventually cause the network to break down. Our remedy is an adaptive “forget gate” that enables an LSTM cell to learn to reset itself at appropriate times, thus releasing internal resources. We review an illustrative benchmark problem on which standard LSTM outperforms other RNN algorithms. All algorithms (including LSTM) fail to solve a continual version of that problem. LSTM with forget gates, however, easily solves it in an elegant way.},

Unfortunately, the few existing human judgment datasets have been created as by-products of the manual evaluations performed during the DUC/TAC shared tasks. However, modern systems are typically better than the best systems submitted at the time of these shared tasks. We show that, surprisingly, evaluation metrics which behave similarly on these datasets (average-scoring range) strongly disagree in the higher-scoring range in which current systems now operate. It is problematic because metrics disagree yet we can{'}t decide which one to trust. This is a call for collecting human judgments for high-scoring summaries as this would resolve the debate over which metrics to trust. This would also be greatly beneficial to further improve summarization systems and metrics alike.}

abstract = {The vast amount of textual information available today is useless unless it can be effectively and efficiently searched. The goal in information retrieval is to find documents that are relevant to a given user query. We can represent and document collection by a matrix whose (i, j) entry is nonzero only if the ith term appears in the jth document; thus each document corresponds to a columm vector. The query is also represented as a column vector whose ith term is nonzero only if the ith term appears in the query. We score each document for relevancy by taking its inner product with the query. The highest-scoring documents are considered the most relevant. Unfortunately, this method does not necessarily retrieve all relevant documents because it is based on literal term matching.  Latent semantic indexing (LSI) replaces the document matrix with an approximation generated by the truncated singular-value decomposition (SVD). This method has been shown to overcome many difficulties associated with literal term matching. In this article we propose replacing the SVD with the semidiscrete decomposition (SDD). We will describe the SDD approximation, show how to compute it, and compare the SDD-based LSI method to the SVD-based LSI methods. We will show that SDD-based LSI does as well as SVD-based LSI in terms of document retrieval while requiring only one-twentieth the storage and one-half the time to compute each query. We will also show how to update the SDD approximation when documents are added or deleted from the document collection.},
