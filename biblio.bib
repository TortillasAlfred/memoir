  abstract  = {In this work, we re-examine the problem of extractive text summarization for long documents. We observe that the process of extracting summarization of human can be divided into two stages: 1) a rough reading stage to look for sketched information, and 2) a subsequent careful reading stage to select key sentences to form the summary. By simulating such a two-stage process, we propose a novel approach for extractive summarization. We formulate the problem as a contextual-bandit problem and solve it with policy gradient. We adopt a convolutional neural network to encode gist of paragraphs for rough reading, and a decision making policy with an adapted termination mechanism for careful reading. Experiments on the CNN and DailyMail datasets show that our proposed method can provide high-quality summaries with varied length, and significantly outperform the state-of-the-art extractive methods in terms of ROUGE metrics.}

  abstract  = {This paper creates a paradigm shift with regard to the way we build neural extractive summarization systems. Instead of following the commonly used framework of extracting sentences individually and modeling the relationship between sentences, we formulate the extractive summarization task as a semantic text matching problem, in which a source document and candidate summaries will be (extracted from the original text) matched in a semantic space. Notably, this paradigm shift to semantic matching framework is well-grounded in our comprehensive analysis of the inherent gap between sentence-level and summary-level extractors based on the property of the dataset. Besides, even instantiating the framework with a simple form of a matching model, we have driven the state-of-the-art extractive result on CNN/DailyMail to a new level (44.41 in ROUGE-1). Experiments on the other five datasets also show the effectiveness of the matching framework. We believe the power of this matching-based summarization framework has not been fully exploited. To encourage more instantiations in the future, we have released our codes, processed dataset, as well as generated summaries in \url{https://github.com/maszhongming/MatchSum}.}

  abstract  = {Bandit based methods for tree search have recently gained popularity when applied to huge trees, e.g. in the game of go [6]. Their efficient exploration of the tree enables to return rapidly a good value, and improve precision if more time is provided. The UCT algorithm [8], a tree search method based on Upper Confidence Bounds (UCB) [2], is believed to adapt locally to the effective smoothness of the tree. However, we show that UCT is "over-optimistic" in some sense, leading to a worst-case regret that may be very poor. We propose alternative bandit algorithms for tree search. First, a modification of UCT using a confidence sequence that scales exponentially in the horizon depth is analyzed. We then consider Flat-UCB performed on the leaves and provide a finite regret bound with high probability. Then, we introduce and analyze a Bandit Algorithm for Smooth Trees (BAST) which takes into account actual smoothness of the rewards for performing efficient "cuts" of sub-optimal branches with high confidence. Finally, we present an incremental tree expansion which applies when the full tree is too big (possibly infinite) to be entirely represented and show that with high probability, only the optimal branches are indefinitely developed. We illustrate these methods on a global optimization problem of a continuous function, given noisy values.},

  abstract  = {The investigation and development of new methods from diverse perspectives to shed light on portfolio choice problems has never stagnated in financial research. Recently, multi-armed bandits have drawn intensive attention in various machine learning applications in online settings. The tradeoff between exploration and exploitation to maximize rewards in bandit algorithms naturally establishes a connection to portfolio choice problems. In this paper, we present a bandit algorithm for conducting online portfolio choices by effectually exploiting correlations among multiple arms. Through constructing orthogonal portfolios from multiple assets and integrating with the upper confidence bound bandit framework, we derive the optimal portfolio strategy that represents the combination of passive and active investments according to a risk-adjusted reward function. Compared with oft-quoted trading strategies in finance and machine learning fields across representative real-world market datasets, the proposed algorithm demonstrates superiority in both risk-adjusted return and cumulative wealth.},

We evaluate these activation function on standard image classification task.
Our experiments suggest that incorporating a non-zero slope for negative part
in rectified activation units could consistently improve the results. Thus our
findings are negative on the common belief that sparsity is the key of good
performance in ReLU. Moreover, on small scale dataset, using deterministic
negative slope or learning it are both prone to overfitting. They are not as
effective as using their randomized counterpart. By using RReLU, we achieved
75.68\% accuracy on CIFAR-100 test set without multiple test or ensemble.}},

Our remedy is an adaptive ‚Äúforget gate‚Äù that enables an LSTM cell to learn to reset itself at appropriate times, thus releasing internal resources. We review an illustrative benchmark problem on which standard LSTM outperforms other RNN algorithms. All algorithms (including LSTM) fail to solve a continual version of that problem.

Unfortunately, the few existing human judgment datasets have been created as by-products of the manual evaluations performed during the DUC/TAC shared tasks. However, modern systems are typically better than the best systems submitted at the time of these shared tasks. We show that, surprisingly, evaluation metrics which behave similarly on these datasets (average-scoring range) strongly disagree in the higher-scoring range in which current systems now operate. It is problematic because metrics disagree yet we can{'}t decide which one to trust. This is a call for collecting human judgments for high-scoring summaries as this would resolve the debate over which metrics to trust. This would also be greatly beneficial to further improve summarization systems and metrics alike.}

abstract = {The vast amount of textual information available today is useless unless it can be effectively and efficiently searched. The goal in information retrieval is to find documents that are relevant to a given user query. We can represent and document collection by a matrix whose (i, j) entry is nonzero only if the ith term appears in the jth document; thus each document corresponds to a columm vector. The query is also represented as a column vector whose ith term is nonzero only if the ith term appears in the query. We score each document for relevancy by taking its inner product with the query. The highest-scoring documents are considered the most relevant. Unfortunately, this method does not necessarily retrieve all relevant documents because it is based on literal term matching.  Latent semantic indexing (LSI) replaces the document matrix with an approximation generated by the truncated singular-value decomposition (SVD). This method has been shown to overcome many difficulties associated with literal term matching. In this article we propose replacing the SVD with the semidiscrete decomposition (SDD). We will describe the SDD approximation, show how to compute it, and compare the SDD-based LSI method to the SVD-based LSI methods. We will show that SDD-based LSI does as well as SVD-based LSI in terms of document retrieval while requiring only one-twentieth the storage and one-half the time to compute each query. We will also show how to update the SDD approximation when documents are added or deleted from the document collection.},

abstract = {"Written by three experts in the field, Deep Learning is the only comprehensive book on the subject." -- Elon Musk, cochair of OpenAI; cofounder and CEO of Tesla and SpaceXDeep learning is a form of machine learning that enables computers to learn from experience and understand the world in terms of a hierarchy of concepts. Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning. The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and videogames. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models. Deep Learning can be used by undergraduate or graduate students planning careers in either industry or research, and by software engineers who want to begin using deep learning in their products or platforms. A website offers supplementary material for both readers and instructors.}

Deep learning approaches have also been found to be suitable for big data analysis with successful applications to computer vision, pattern recognition, speech recognition, natural language processing, and recommendation systems. In this paper, we discuss some widely-used deep learning architectures and their practical applications. An up-to-date overview is provided on four deep learning architectures, namely, autoencoder, convolutional neural network, deep belief network, and restricted Boltzmann machine. Different types of deep neural networks are surveyed and recent progresses are summarized. Applications of deep learning techniques on some selected areas (speech recognition, pattern recognition and computer vision) are highlighted. A list of future research topics are finally given with clear justifications."

    abstract = "We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5 (7.7 point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7{\%} (4.6{\%} absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).",

At the same time, the opponent chooses a ‚Äúloss‚Äù vector in Rd and the forecaster suffers a loss that is the inner product of the two vectors. The goal of the forecaster is to achieve that, in the long run, the accumulated loss is not much larger than that of the best possible element in S. We consider the ‚Äúbandit‚Äù setting in which the forecaster only has access to the losses of the chosen vectors (i.e., the entire loss vectors are not observed). We introduce a variant of a strategy by Dani, Hayes and Kakade achieving a regret bound that, for a variety of concrete choices of S, is of order ndln|S| where n is the time horizon. This is not improvable in general and is better than previously known bounds. The examples we consider are all such that S‚äÜ{0,1}d, and we show how the combinatorial structure of these classes can be exploited to improve the regret bounds. We also point out computationally efficient implementations for various interesting choices of S."

In the stochastic setting under semi-bandit feedback, we derive a problem-specific regret lower bound, and discuss its scaling with the dimension of the decision space. We propose ESCB, an algorithm that efficiently exploits the structure of the problem and provide a finite-time analysis of its regret. ESCB has better performance guarantees than existing algorithms, and significantly outperforms these algorithms in practice.
